There is a small issue with the segue which I couldn't fix. The segue will probably happen immediately and bring up the tableviewcontroller. If it does tap on the back button. The logic of the geoquiz works perfectly, the pins do get removed if the answer is correct and you will get a point. However, just the segue is a small issue.
